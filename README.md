# MyWebsite

This is a website about myself that I created using Bootstrap. It was a neat way to learn html and how a website is created.

Website is at thomasthansen.com

Can be compiled by running npm start

Deployment Process

- Super Simple
- Compress the files/folders in the dist folder to a zip file after compiling/building the image
- Upload the zip file to bluehost
